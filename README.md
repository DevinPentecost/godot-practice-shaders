# godot-practice-shaders
A collection of practice shaders in the Godot engine.

Each shader is in it's own directory, and has an example scene, so please check them out. They have their own README files with more details as well.

The .gif recordings don't do them justice (low quality, inconsistent framerate) - I recommend you download them and run them yourself!

If you are interested in using this repo as a guide for learning, I highly recommend you follow along and _type in the code yourself_. It will never *stick* if you don't physically type them out - no copy and paste!

## Shader Complexity
For those who are brand new to shader programming (like I was) this is a _rough_ order you can follow. They start relatively simply and progress towards more complex.

1. [reveal](reveal)
1. [invert](invert)
1. [transition](transition)
1. [color_fade](color_fade)

## Inspiration
Many of these shaders are inspired from YouTube Shader tutorials, such as:
* [Makin' Stuff Look Good](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEklP9iLcpExB8vp_fWQseg)
* Games that I've played that have shaders that interest me

## Tools
* These shaders were written in and for the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)
* Other Text/Code editing done in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* Videos recorded using [LICECap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/), [ScreenToGif](http://www.screentogif.com/) and [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)
* Most (if not all) images created using [Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/)
