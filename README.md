# practice-shaders
A collection of practice shaders for the Godot engine.

Each shader is in it's own scene, so please check them out. They have their own README files with more details.

The .gif recordings don't do them justice (low, inconsistent framerate) - I recommend you download them and run them yourself!

## Inspiration
Many of these shaders are inspired from YouTube Shader tutorials, such as:
* [Makin' Stuff Look Good](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEklP9iLcpExB8vp_fWQseg)
* Games that I've played that have shaders that interest me

## Tools
* These shaders were written in and for the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)
* Other Text/Code editing done in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* Videos recorded using [LICECap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/), [ScreenToGif](http://www.screentogif.com/) and [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)
* Most (if not all) images created using [Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/)
